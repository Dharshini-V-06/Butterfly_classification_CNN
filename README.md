##  Butterfly Species Classification

###  Overview

This project classifies butterfly species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.
It applies transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for efficient feature extraction and achieves around 79% validation accuracy across 75 classes.
